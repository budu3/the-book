# Preface
With the recent proliferation of Apps I felt that there was a need for a book to teach the average
Jane how to develop their own apps. The web has been with us for a while now and
many of the technologies and terminologies are familiar to us. We are familiar with
what a webpage is, what a link is, what a browser is etc. Building on this familiarity, my
aim is to show that with relative ease anyone can start developing their own app.

## How this book is organized
This book is divided into self contained chapters of increasing difficulty. You can jump between chapters and
pick topics that interest you. Each chapter has accompanying code that can be downloaded and run, or read from within the text. Another way to read this book is to read it in order from the first chapter to the last.

## Who should read this book
This book can be read by a complete novice. It can also be read by anyone with basic web development knowledge. 

The book begins with a gentle introduction to the main web technologies, HTML, CSS and Javascript. We then move on to learn how to set up a development environment for developing our apps. You will then create your first simple app. Subsequent chapters touch on the DOM, touch events, saving data, swipe action and finally how to publish your app.

## Source Code
The code for each chapter can be downloaded from Github
